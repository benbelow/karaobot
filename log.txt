65:'Cos he knows that it's me 
66:they've been coming to see 
67:to forget about life for a while 
68:And the piano sounds 
69:like a carnival 
70:and the microphone 
71:smells like a beer 
72:And they sit at the bar 
73:and put bread in my jar 
74:and say "Man what 
75:are you doing here?" 
76:Oh la la la la la la 
77:La la la la la la 
78:Sing us a song 
79:you're the piano man 
80:sing us a song tonight 
81:Well we're all in 
82:the mood for a melody 
83:and you've got 
84:us feeling alright 
1:It's nine o'clock on a Saturday 
2:the regular crowd shuffles in 
3:There's an old man 
4:sitting next to me 
5:Making love to 
6:his tonic and gin 
7:He says "Son can 
8:you play me a memory? 
9:I'm not really sure how it goes 
10:But it's sad and it's sweet 
11:and I knew it complete 
12:When I wore a 
13:younger man's clothes" 
14:La la la la la la 
15:La la la la la la la 
16:Sing us a song 
17:you're the piano man 
18:Sing us a song tonight 
19:Well we're all in the 
20:mood for a melody 
21:And you've got 
22:us feeling alright 
23:Now John at the 
24:bar is a friend of mine 
25:He gets me my 
26:drinks for free 
27:And he's quick with a joke 
28:or to light up your smoke 
29:But there's some place 
30:that he'd rather be 
31:He says "Bill I believe 
32:this is killing me" 
33:As the smile ran away 
34:from his face 
35:"Well I'm sure that 
36:I could be a movie star 
37:if I could get out of this place" 
38:Oh la la la la la la 
39:La la la la la la la 
40:Now Paul is a real 
41:estate novelist 
42:who never had time for a wife 
43:And he's talking with Davy 
44:who's still in the Navy 
45:And probably will be for life 
46:And the waitress is 
47:practicing politics 
48:as the businessmen 
49:slowly get stoned 
50:Yes they're sharing 
51:a drink they call loneliness 
52:but it's better 
53:than drinking alone 
54:Sing us a song 
55:you're the piano man 
56:sing us a song tonight 
57:Well we're all in 
58:the mood for a melody 
59:and you've got 
60:us feeling alright 
61:It's a pretty good crowd 
62:for a Saturday 
63:and the manager 
64:gives me a smile 
65:'Cos he knows that it's me 
66:they've been coming to see 
67:to forget about life for a while 
68:And the piano sounds 
69:like a carnival

76:Oh la la la la la la 
77:La la la la la la 
78:Sing us a song 
79:you're the piano man 
80:sing us a song tonight 
81:Well we're all in 
82:the mood for a melody 
83:and you've got 
84:us feeling alright 
1:Oh, life is bigger 
2:it's bigger than you 
3:and you are not me 
4:The lengths that I will go to 
5:the distance in your eyes 
6:Oh, no I've said too much 
7:I set it up 
8:That's me in the corner 
9:that's me in the spot light 
10:Losing my religion 
11:trying to keep up with you 
12:And I don't know if I can do it 
13:Oh no I've said too much

1:Hello darkness my old friend 
2:I've come to talk 
3:with you again 
4:Because a vision 
5:softly creeping 
6:left its seeds 
7:while I was sleeping 
8:And the vision 
9:that was planted 
10:in my brain 
11:still remains 
12:Within the sound 
13:of silence 
14:In restless dreams 
15:I walked alone 
16:Narrow streets 
17:of Cobblestone 
18:'Neath the halo 
19:of a street lamp 
20:I turned my collar 
21:to the cold and damp 
22:When my eyes were stabbed 
23:by the flash of a neon light 
24:that split the night 
25:And touched the sound 
26:of silence 
27:And in the naked light I saw 
28:ten thousand people 
29:maybe more 
30:People talking 
31:without speaking 
32:People hearing 
33:without listening 
34:People writing songs 
35:that voices never share 
36:and no one dare 
37:Disturb the sound 
38:of silence 
39:Fools said I you do not know 
40:Silence like a cancer grows 
41:Hear my words 
42:that I might teach you 
43:Take my arms 
44:that I might reach you 
45:But my words 
46:like silent raindrops fell 
47:And echoed in the wells 
48:of silence 
49:And the people 
50:bowed and prayed 
51:to the neon God they made 
52:And the sign 
53:flashed out its warning 
54:And the words 
55:that it was forming 
56:And the sign said 
57:the words of the prophets 
58:are written on 
59:the subway walls 
60:And tenement halls

5:How I hate to spend 
6:the evening on my own 
7:Autumn winds 
8:Blowing outside 
9:the window as I look 
10:around the room 
11:And it makes me so depressed 
12:to see the gloom 
13:There's not a soul out there 
14:no one to hear my prayer 
15:Gimme gimme gimme 
16:a man after midnight 
17:Won't somebody help me 
18:chase the shadows away? 
19:Gimme gimme gimme 
20:a man after midnight 
21:Take me through the darkness 
22:to the break of the day 
23:Movie stars 
24:Find the end of the rainbow 
25:with a fortune to win 
26:It's so different from 
27:the world I'm living in 
28:Tired of T.V. 
29:I open the window 
30:and I gaze into the night 
31:But there's nothing 
32:there to see no one in sight 
33:There's not a soul out there 
34:no one to hear my prayer 
35:Gimme gimme gimme 
36:a man after midnight 
37:Won't somebody help me

1:I wasn't jealous 
2:before we met 
3:Now every woman 
4:I see is a potential threat 
5:And I'm possessive 
6:it isn't nice 
7:You've heard me saying that 
8:smoking was my only vice 
9:But now it isn't true 
10:now everything is new 
11:And all I've learned 
12:has overturned 
13:I beg of you 
14:Don't go wasting your emotion 
15:lay all your love on me 
16:It was like shooting 
17:a sitting duck 
18:A little smalltalk 
19:a smile and baby I was stuck 
20:I still don't know 
21:what you've done with me 
22:A grown up woman 
23:should never fall so easily 
24:I feel a kind of fear 
25:when I don't have you near 
26:Unsatisfied, I skip my pride 
27:I beg you dear 
28:Don't go wasting your emotion 
29:lay all your love on me 
30:Don't go sharing your devotion 
31:lay all your love on me 
32:I've had a few little love affairs 
33:they didn't last very long 
34:and they've been pretty scarce 
35:I used to think 
36:that was sensible 
37:It makes the truth 
38:even more incomprehensible 
39:'Cos everything is new 
40:and everything is you 
41:And all I've learned 
42:has overturned 
43:what can I do 
44:Don't go wasting your emotion 
45:lay all your love on me 
46:Don't go sharing your devotion 
47:lay all your love on me 
48:Don't go wasting your emotion 
49:lay all your love on me 
50:Don't go sharing your devotion 
51:lay all your love on me 
52:Don't go wasting your emotion 
53:lay all your love on me 
1:You're so hot 
2:teasing me 
3:You're so blue 
4:but I can't take a chance 
5:on a chick like you 
6:It's something I couldn't do 
7:There's that look 
8:in your eyes 
9:I can read in your face 
10:that your feelings 
11:are driving you wild 
12:Ah but girl 
13:you're only a child 
14:Well I can dance 
15:with you honey 
16:If you think it's funny 
17:Does your mother 
18:know that you're out? 
19:And I can chat 
20:with you baby 
21:Flirt a little maybe 
22:Does your mother 
23:know that you're out? 
24:Take it easy 
25:Better slow down girl 
26:That's no way to go 
27:Take it easy 
28:Try to cool it girl 
29:Take it nice and slow 
30:I can see 
31:what you want 
32:But you seem pretty young 
33:to be searching 
34:for that kind of fun 
35:So maybe I'm not the one 
36:Now you're so cute 
37:I like your style 
38:And I know what you mean

26:and my pain walks down 
27:a one-way street 
28:I look above 
29:and I know I'll always 
30:be blessed with love 
31:And as the feeling grows 
32:she breathes flesh to my bones 
33:And when love is dead  
34:I'm loving angels instead 
35:And through it all 
36:she offers me protection

1:Stop making the eyes at me 
2:I'll stop making the 
3:eyes at you 
4:What it is that surprises 
5:me is that I don't really 
6:want you too 
7:And your shoulders are frozen 
8:oh but you're an explosion 
9:Your name isn't Rio 
10:but I don't care for sand and 
11:lighting the fuse might result 
12:in a bang b-b-bang go 
13:I bet that you look 
14:good on the dance floor 
15:I don't know if you're 
16:looking for romance or 
17:I don't know what 
18:you're looking for 
19:Well I bet that you look 
20:good on the dance floor 
21:dancing to electro-pop 
22:Like a robot from 
23:nineteen eighty-four 
24:from nineteen eighty-four

26:me because it's sending 
27:me to despair 
28:Without a sound 
29:yeah, you're calling me 
30:and I don't think it's very fair 
31:That your shoulders are frozen
