65:'Cos he knows that it's me 
66:they've been coming to see 
67:to forget about life for a while 
68:And the piano sounds 
69:like a carnival 
70:and the microphone 
71:smells like a beer 
72:And they sit at the bar 
73:and put bread in my jar 
74:and say "Man what 
75:are you doing here?" 
76:Oh la la la la la la 
77:La la la la la la 
78:Sing us a song 
79:you're the piano man 
80:sing us a song tonight 
81:Well we're all in 
82:the mood for a melody 
83:and you've got 
84:us feeling alright 
1:It's nine o'clock on a Saturday 
2:the regular crowd shuffles in 
3:There's an old man 
4:sitting next to me 
5:Making love to 
6:his tonic and gin 
7:He says "Son can 
8:you play me a memory? 
9:I'm not really sure how it goes 
10:But it's sad and it's sweet 
11:and I knew it complete 
12:When I wore a 
13:younger man's clothes" 
14:La la la la la la 
15:La la la la la la la 
16:Sing us a song 
17:you're the piano man 
18:Sing us a song tonight 
19:Well we're all in the 
20:mood for a melody 
21:And you've got 
22:us feeling alright 
23:Now John at the 
24:bar is a friend of mine 
25:He gets me my 
26:drinks for free 
27:And he's quick with a joke 
28:or to light up your smoke 
29:But there's some place 
30:that he'd rather be 
31:He says "Bill I believe 
32:this is killing me" 
33:As the smile ran away 
34:from his face 
35:"Well I'm sure that 
36:I could be a movie star 
37:if I could get out of this place" 
38:Oh la la la la la la 
39:La la la la la la la 
40:Now Paul is a real 
41:estate novelist 
42:who never had time for a wife 
43:And he's talking with Davy 
44:who's still in the Navy 
45:And probably will be for life 
46:And the waitress is 
47:practicing politics 
48:as the businessmen 
49:slowly get stoned 
50:Yes they're sharing 
51:a drink they call loneliness 
52:but it's better 
53:than drinking alone 
54:Sing us a song 
55:you're the piano man 
56:sing us a song tonight 
57:Well we're all in 
58:the mood for a melody 
59:and you've got 
60:us feeling alright 
61:It's a pretty good crowd 
62:for a Saturday 
63:and the manager 
64:gives me a smile 
65:'Cos he knows that it's me 
66:they've been coming to see 
67:to forget about life for a while 
68:And the piano sounds 
69:like a carnival

76:Oh la la la la la la 
77:La la la la la la 
78:Sing us a song 
79:you're the piano man 
80:sing us a song tonight 
81:Well we're all in 
82:the mood for a melody 
83:and you've got 
84:us feeling alright 
1:Oh, life is bigger 
2:it's bigger than you 
3:and you are not me 
4:The lengths that I will go to 
5:the distance in your eyes 
6:Oh, no I've said too much 
7:I set it up 
8:That's me in the corner 
9:that's me in the spot light 
10:Losing my religion 
11:trying to keep up with you 
12:And I don't know if I can do it 
13:Oh no I've said too much
